# Final-Project

## Purpose Of The Project:
The purpose of this project is to create an overview of the cost of a big mac from McDonalds and match that data against annual GDP of Nations to see if there is a correlation. The project will consist of two elements:

1. Regional Dashboard: Dashboard will provide a summary of each nations cost of a big mac vs. GDP.

2. Correlation model: the model will provide an analysis of whether the increase of gdp and the increase of the cost of a big mac are correlated.

Questions To Answer
How does the price of BigMac correlate with the GDP (worldwide) over time (2000-2021)?

which country(top 5) have the largest cost increase?

which country(top 5) have the smallest cost increase?

which region has the highest cost increase? 

which region has the lowest cost increase? 

How does the price correlate with the top and bottom 50 GDP’s?
